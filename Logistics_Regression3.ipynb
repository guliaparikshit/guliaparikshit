        "- **Precision** measures how many of the positive predictions made by the model are actually correct. It is useful when the cost of false positives is high (e.g., wrongly predicting a patient has a disease when they do not).\n",
        "- **Recall** measures how many actual positive cases the model correctly identified. It is important when missing a positive instance is costly (e.g., failing to identify fraudulent transactions).\n",
        "  \n",
        "In classification models, balancing precision and recall is important depending on the problem's needs. For instance, in medical testing, recall might be prioritized to ensure that all possible cases are detected.\n",

        "- The **F1 score** is the harmonic mean of **precision** and **recall**, providing a single metric that balances both. It’s especially useful when the class distribution is imbalanced and you need a measure that takes both false positives and false negatives into account.\n",
        "- Unlike precision and recall, which measure specific aspects of the model’s performance, the F1 score combines them to give a single value that helps to understand overall performance in a balanced way.\n",

        "**Q3. What is ROC and AUC, and how are they used to evaluate the performance of classification models?**  \n",
        "- **ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)** is a curve that plots the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate at different threshold levels. It shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.\n",
        "- **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** is the area under the ROC curve. A higher AUC means the model is better at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes.\n",
        "  \n",

        "- **Multiclass classification** involves classifying instances into more than two classes (e.g., classifying an image as either a cat, dog, or bird). It requires different evaluation methods, as there are more than two outcomes.\n",
        "- **Binary classification** involves only two classes (e.g., positive or negative), so it is simpler in terms of model design and evaluation.\n",

        "  - **One-vs-All (OvA)**: For each class, a separate binary logistic regression model is trained to distinguish that class from all others. The model with the highest probability is chosen as the prediction.\n",
