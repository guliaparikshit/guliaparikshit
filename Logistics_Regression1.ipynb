        "**Q1. Explain the difference between linear regression and logistic regression models. Provide an example of a scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate.**  \n",
        "- **Linear Regression** is used for predicting a continuous outcome, like predicting sales or house prices based on input features.\n",
        "  - **Example**: Predicting the price of a house based on its size, location, and number of bedrooms.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Logistic Regression** is used for binary classification, where the outcome is a category (usually 0 or 1, yes or no).\n",
        "  - **Example**: Predicting whether a customer will buy a product (1) or not (0) based on their browsing history.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Q2. What is the cost function used in logistic regression, and how is it optimized?**  \n",
        "- In **logistic regression**, the cost function measures how far the modelâ€™s predictions are from the actual outcomes. The goal is to **minimize** this cost function to improve the model's accuracy.  \n",
        "- The model is optimized by adjusting its parameters (coefficients) to minimize the cost using an algorithm called **gradient descent**, which iteratively makes small changes to the parameters to reduce the cost.\n",

        "**Q3. Explain the concept of regularization in logistic regression and how it helps prevent overfitting.**  \n",
        "- **Regularization** is a technique used to make the model simpler and prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too well, making it perform poorly on new data.\n",
        "- Regularization adds a penalty to the model for using large coefficients, encouraging it to use smaller, more general coefficients. This helps the model focus on the most important features and avoid overfitting.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Q4. What is the ROC curve, and how is it used to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model?**  \n",
        "- The **ROC curve** (Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) is a graph that shows how well the model distinguishes between two classes (e.g., \"yes\" vs \"no\").\n",
        "- It plots the **True Positive Rate** (the percentage of actual positives that are correctly identified) against the **False Positive Rate** (the percentage of actual negatives that are incorrectly classified as positives).\n",
        "- The **Area Under the Curve (AUC)** is a value between 0 and 1 that tells you how good the model is at distinguishing between classes. The closer it is to 1, the better the model.\n",

        "**Q5. What are some common techniques for feature selection in logistic regression? How do these techniques help improve the model's performance?**  \n",
        "1. **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Removes less important features to improve the model's accuracy and reduce complexity.\n",
        "2. **L1 Regularization**: Automatically removes irrelevant features by shrinking their coefficients to zero, which helps simplify the model.\n",
        "3. **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies and removes highly correlated features, reducing redundancy and preventing multicollinearity, which can make the model unstable.\n",
        "4. **Chi-Square Test**: Measures the relationship between categorical features and the target variable, helping you select the most relevant features.\n",
        "\n",
        "By selecting the most important features, you help the model become simpler, faster, and less likely to overfit.\n",

        "**Q6. How can you handle imbalanced datasets in logistic regression? What are some strategies for dealing with class imbalance?**  \n",
        "1. **Resampling**: Either **oversample** the minority class (e.g., adding more data points) or **undersample** the majority class (e.g., removing some data points) to balance the dataset.\n",
        "2. **Class Weights**: Adjust the importance of each class in the model by assigning higher weights to the minority class so the model pays more attention to it.\n",
        "3. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use techniques like **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic data for the minority class.\n",
        "4. **Anomaly Detection**: Treat the minority class as an anomaly and apply techniques designed to detect rare events.\n",
        "\n",
        "These strategies help ensure the model doesn't ignore the minority class and makes more balanced predictions.\n",

        "**Q7. Can you discuss some common issues and challenges that may arise when implementing logistic regression, and how they can be addressed? For example, what can be done if there is multicollinearity among the independent variables?**  \n",
        "1. **Multicollinearity**: This occurs when independent variables are highly correlated, making it difficult for the model to determine the individual effect of each variable.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Remove highly correlated features, use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to combine correlated variables, or apply **L2 regularization** to reduce the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Overfitting**: When the model is too complex, it might perform well on training data but poorly on new data.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Use **regularization** to simplify the model, apply **cross-validation** to tune hyperparameters, and ensure the model is generalizing well.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Non-linearity**: Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target, which might not always be true.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Transform features (e.g., using polynomial features) or use a different model that can capture non-linear relationships, such as decision trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Imbalanced Data**: When one class is much more common than the other, the model may be biased towards predicting the majority class.\n",
        "   - **Solution**: Use techniques like resampling, class weighting, or anomaly detection to address the imbalance.\n",
