        "\n",
        "Bayes' theorem is a method used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It provides a way to revise our beliefs or predictions about an event by combining prior knowledge (the initial probability of the hypothesis) with new data (evidence). It is particularly useful when you have an initial belief and want to adjust that belief after considering new information.\n",

        "Bayes' theorem provides a way to compute the updated probability of a hypothesis given new data. It combines:\n",
        "- The prior probability, which represents what we initially believed about the hypothesis before seeing the new evidence.\n",
        "- The likelihood, which is how probable the new evidence is under the hypothesis.\n",

        "- **Medical Diagnosis**: It helps doctors update the probability of a disease based on the results of diagnostic tests.\n",
        "- **Spam Filtering**: It is used to classify emails as spam or not by updating the likelihood that an email is spam based on the words it contains.\n",
        "- **Decision Making**: In fields like finance or insurance, it helps assess the likelihood of future events or risks by continuously updating probabilities based on new data.\n",

        "\n",
        "Bayes' theorem is based on **conditional probability**, which is the probability of an event happening given that another event has occurred. It allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (such as a disease being present) after considering new evidence (such as the result of a medical test). Essentially, Bayes' theorem helps calculate the probability of a hypothesis, given the new data or evidence, by using the principles of conditional probability.\n",

        "- **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: This classifier is used when the features are continuous and assumed to follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution.\n",
        "- **Multinomial Naive Bayes**: This is appropriate when your data consists of counts or frequencies, such as in text classification where the features might represent word counts.\n",
        "- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**: Use this when the features are binary (e.g., presence or absence of a characteristic).\n",
        "\n",
        "The classifier you choose is determined by the nature of your data and the assumptions you can make about it.\n",
