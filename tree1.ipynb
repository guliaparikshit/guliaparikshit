        "- A **decision tree classifier** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to classify data based on feature values. The algorithm works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets. At each step, it chooses the feature that best separates the data according to some criteria (such as reducing impurity). The tree consists of nodes, branches, and leaves:\n",
        "  - **Nodes** represent a decision based on a feature.\n",
        "  - **Branches** represent the outcome of that decision.\n",
        "  - **Leaves** represent the final predicted class.\n",

        "- The **mathematical intuition** behind decision trees is based on the concept of dividing the data into pure subsets that are as homogenous as possible in terms of the target class. The tree chooses features that result in the best separation at each step.\n",
        "  1. Start with the entire dataset.\n",
        "  2. Find the feature and split that results in the best division of the data (i.e., the feature that minimizes impurity or maximizes purity).\n",

        "- In **binary classification**, a decision tree splits the data at each node based on the feature that best divides the two classes (e.g., positive and negative). Each branch represents a possible feature value, and each leaf node corresponds to one of the classes. For prediction:\n",
        "  - The tree uses the feature values of a new instance to traverse from the root to a leaf node.\n",
        "  - Once the instance reaches a leaf, the model predicts the class assigned to that leaf (either positive or negative).\n",

        "  - In two dimensions, each split divides the data space into two parts, with a decision boundary perpendicular to one of the axes (features).\n",
        "  - As the tree grows deeper, these boundaries become more complex, forming non-overlapping regions that correspond to different classes.\n",
